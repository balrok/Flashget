* display
==================
    * whole display is a problem, since the new implementation of dynamic line-breaks
    * if terminal gets resized, the program crashes

* flashdownload
==================
    * TODO: create different queues for different videoportals
        * when megavideo stops our download, sleep in this queue until we can continue, and resume aborted downloads

* output
==================
    * if output gets piped in a file, we don't need to draw ncurses-things - implement a wrapper which will then output everything raw
    * python-errors aren't thrown very nice (but i think i can't fix it)

* threading
==================
    * replace this with subprocessing, to allow real parallel work

* other
==================
    * animeloads encoding is broken
