Version 3 (???)
- stream_extract: implement putlocker
- improved cache interface
- added new caches (Leveldb, HypterTable, KyotoCacheComp (=Kyotocabinet with compression turned on))
- urlmanager will look if it received binary data and won't cache it
- http library improvements (header parsing, error handling)
- nicely close the program and join all threads
- own extension manager
- extension manager for pages and streams
- direct download of streams via commandline
- streams are objects now too


Version 2 (17.Nov 2011)
===========================
after so long time another version increment is needed
change in version numbering cause of simplicity

- allow disabling of curses interface
- improved http library with many bugfixes
- (re-)implement animeloads, eliteanimes, movie-loads, kinox.to
- extracting all data from sites and store it into a mysql database
- improved extract-interface
- allow multithreaded extract-all through specifying start and amount
- replaced my own cache implementation with kyotocabinet cause filesystem got too slow
- dropped idea of client-server style program

Version 1.1.0 (25.Jul 2009)
===========================
again no particular reason for this, i just think this version is stable (:

- generic xvid implementation + some supported pages for it
- my http-implementation
  - bugfix: correctly get the port from a link
  - bugfix: keywords (like content-length) in http-protcol aren't casesensitive
  - using a dns-cache
- added crypt-it container.. but currently they don't realy work.. you just can
  display the links inside a container
- first idea + some code about making this program in a client-server style
  to support later more guis (but currently doesn't work)
- many other smaller things, just use git cherry -v 7e46d271


Version 1.0.0
==============
there is no particular reason why exactly this revision got version 1, it's
just that i can add a version with the commandline-option

cause this is the first version, i will mostly list features here:
 - tools for easy adding new commandline options
 - own http-class which implements keep-alive and which is (compared to other python http-libs) very small
 - classes to handle the webpages, where flashfiles can be found. supported pages:
    + anime-loads, animekiwi, anime-junkies, youtube, kino.to
 - classes to handle the flv-streams, which can extract a direct-download link. supported streams:
    + veoh, eatlime, megavideo, hdweb, sevenload, youtube, imeem, hdshare, zeec, plain (direct dl-link is inside html)
 - class for logging + config-params to filter some logging stuff
    not very advanced yet
 - class for creating a gui in ncurses
    not very advanced yet + has some bugs with the scrolling in those logs
    but has already some nice features and is, i think, quite fast
