version 1.0.0
==============
there is no particular reason why exactly this revision got version 1, it's
just that i can add a version with the commandline-option

cause this is the first version, i will mostly list features here:
 - tools for easy adding new commandline options
 - own http-class which implements keep-alive and which is (compared to other python http-libs) very small
 - classes to handle the webpages, where flashfiles can be found. supported pages:
    + anime-loads, animekiwi, anime-junkies, youtube, kino.to
 - classes to handle the flv-streams, which can extract a direct-download link. supported streams:
    + veoh, eatlime, megavideo, hdweb, sevenload, youtube, imeem, hdshare, zeec, plain (direct dl-link is inside html)
 - class for logging + config-params to filter some logging stuff
    not very advanced yet
 - class for creating a gui in ncurses
    not very advanced yet + has some bugs with the scrolling in those logs
    but has already some nice features and is, i think, quite fast
