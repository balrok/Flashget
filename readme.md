Flashget
A tool to download flashstreams from movie-streaming sites like kinox.to or anime-loads.org

Bugs:
Since all webpages change often and the program relies on the html-structure of them I think all pages are broken.
The ncurses interface might not work - at least I haven't used it since long ago.

Features:
- Support(ed) several streaming sites as kinox.to anime-loads.org movie-loads animeseed eliteanimes
- Support(ed) several streamhoster like: bitshare, megavideo, eatlime, videobb, myvideo, stagevu, veoh, sevenload, putlocker/sockshare,
  zeec, ccf and generic xvid, directdownload
- allows to build up a database from the streamhoster - I made a little php stream-database with that if there is interest mail me
- extensive caching with various backends
- multiple downloads / queues
- many hidden bugs and eastereggs

About:
This project is currently dead. I developed it long time just for me because I think it's not good if such a tool exists because the hoster
won't get money from their advertisements. But since it is broken anyway I guess noone will use it for bad. Also I feel like giving
something back after I copied so much of foreign algorithms.

In this project I developed an own http-library based on sockets. This was needed since I disliked the python defaultimplementation and the
requests library wasn't available yet. The http-lib is quite robust since it came over many errors while crawling. But I won't say it has no
errors. Also it doesn't has the cleanest code. If I had the time I would try to replace it with requests.

Another thing I developed was a simple plugin interface which is responsible for adding new stream-hoster and streaming sites. You just need
to tell it the directory and it will autodetect every class which implements the plugin interface. After much googling I didn't find
anything as simple and easy than what I did.

Random cool things are:
    The textextract function which realy helps with extracting information from known html layout.
    The various cache implementations under one interface + converting-function.
    Perhaps the datastructure to put the streamsite-content into db.

Thanks:
Many download-algorithms are from foreign websites or foreign source code. I'm not sure if I marked every codesection as such. But still
want to thank them for making their software opensource or writing good blog posts.
