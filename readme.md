A tool to download flashstreams from movie-streaming sites like kinox.to or anime-loads.org

## Bugs:

Since all webpages change often and the program relies on the html-structure of them many pages and streams are not working.
Currently (21.04.2014) the page [ddl.me](http://ddl.me) and the streams [streamcloud](http://streamcloud.eu),
[nowvideo](http://nowvideo.sx), [firedrive](http://firedrive.com) are working.
To check the streams you can run `python stream_tests.py`.

## Features:

- Support(ed) several streaming sites as kinox.to anime-loads.org movie-loads animeseed eliteanimes
- Support(ed) several streamhoster like: bitshare, megavideo, eatlime, videobb, myvideo, stagevu, veoh, sevenload, putlocker/sockshare,
  zeec, ccf and generic xvid, directdownload
- allows to build up a database from the streamhoster - I made a little php stream-database with that if there is interest mail me
- extensive caching with various backends
- multiple downloads / queues
- many hidden bugs and eastereggs

## Thanks:

Many download-algorithms are from foreign websites or foreign source code. I'm not sure if I marked every codesection as such. But still
want to thank them for making their software opensource or writing good blog posts. If you find uncredited code please write me - it was no
bad intent :)

## Contributing:

If you like to improve this program but don't like the ugly code - just send me a mail and I will help you.
